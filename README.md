# Mini-DBMS-Java
in this project we developed a DBMS(database management system) which allows me to create tables,insert records,delete records,update records and retrieve data from a table.We also created a bit map index to optimize query performance and the bitmap index gets updated whenever data is inserted to or deleted from the table.
